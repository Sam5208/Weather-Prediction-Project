# Weather-Prediction-Project
This is a project I did for fun and to get myself familiar with data processing in Python and conduct simple linear data analysis and prediction. Here are major steps this project includes:

1. Data Loading: Reads the weather dataset using libraries like pandas.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): xamines trends in weather variables such as temperature and humidity, identifies patterns, and checks data distribution using plots and descriptive statistics.
3. Data Cleaning: it handles missing or inconsistent values by filling, interpolating, or removing them and ensures all data points are valid. It also addresses outliers to avoid skewed results.
4. Feature Engineering: it extracts meaningful features from raw data (e.g., averages, differences, or time-based transformations) and scales the features to improve model performance using Ridge regression.
5. Model Training: Implements Ridge regression using sklearn.linear_model.
6. Model Evaluation: Uses metrics such as Mean Squared Error to assess predictions.

Overall, this project helped me improve my skills in data processing, analysis, and prediction using Python.
